In this project. I used a big dataset I scraped before of a few thousand perfume links for their characteristics, like perfume name, designer, fragrance family, main accords, average vote, people's opinions and willingness to purchase, in numbers. etc. 
My goal is two fold, 
a. to create a predictive model for the perfumes that didn't have an average vote, 
b. to give insight and business recommendations to designers on perfumes that sell and are well received globally. 
I have a previous repository named "recommender_system". I used the same collected data, but I used the reviews of a 500 perfumes, instead of the almost 5000 I have, for quicker handling and showcase. 

I stard with cleaning and preparing the data frame, in the notbook called `perfume_chars_preparation.ipynb`
The primitive collection of data is in a separate folder named `from_scratch`. 
The analysis in the notebook called `perfume_chars_analysis.ipynb`
